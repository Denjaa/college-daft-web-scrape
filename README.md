# Daft scraper 

This code was developed by me as a part of my assignment for a college where user can scrape standard data (price, bedrooms, batchrooms, type, address) for as many counties as needed. Currently this code is developed for Dublin, Meath, Kildare and Wexford but user can simply add more counties if needed
